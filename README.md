# My Experimentation Process

---

I wanted my model to be as accurate as I could get it. To achieve this goal, I started simple with one convolutional layer and one hidden layer for no reason other than to understand how I should proceed. The accuracy was very low, about 5%. I then attempted to tweak my sequential model by adding another convolutional layer. Surprisingly, the accuracy increased by about 90%! I noticed that the model's accuracy varies by about 2%. After, I spent a lot of time trying to modify and add more convolutional layers, hidden layers, and dropouts. However, the accuracy either didn't change much or went back to 5%. I decided I couldn't increase the accuracy further and kept the model.
